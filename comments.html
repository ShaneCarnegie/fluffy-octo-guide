        This Class was very challenging because of JavaScript but I enjoyed the challenge.  What I learned about JavaScript is that its
         a powerful programming language used for web development, and it has become an important part of the programming community. 
         This dynamic language is interpreted at runtime, and it can be used for both frontend and backend web development which makes it very dynamic.
          JavaScript can be used to create dynamic and interactive web pages, as well as server-side applications. If I could offer any advice to someone new
           to learning JavaScript the first I would tell them is to make sure they take no shortcuts. Javascript is an exciting language to learn but you must
            learn its syntax, or you will be sitting with the same error for hours, even days.  Learning the basics is a must because when you code more extensive projects 
            there is a good chance you will have to go back to something you learned at the beginning of your journey. Secondly, Do not give up, I am not the strongest coder but I try my best to figure things out.
